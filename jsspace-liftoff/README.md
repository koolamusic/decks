Single responsibility principle - applicable to JavaScript.
Open/closed principle - JavaScript excels at this.
Liksov substitution principle - duck typing of JavaScript makes this easy to do. But you need TDD-style unit tests to make this robust.
Interface segregation principle - duck typing makes this not much of an issue.
Dependency inversion principle - duck typing, again, makes this easy to do. Still have to DO IT, though... low coupling, high cohesion.
