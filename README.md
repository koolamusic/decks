Opensource The Business and Legal Side 

Exploring the business opportunities in opensource projects, legal 
implications, frameworks and roles that can improve sustainability of 
such projects.









Open Source THE BUSINESS SIDE



- Introduction About OSS

We are in an information economy, since the industrial revolution we have communication, computational capacity, experience and social influence in the power of humans.


- Governance Model 
BDFL: BDFL stands for “Benevolent Dictator for Life”. Under this structure, one person (usually the initial author of the project) has final say on all major project decisions. Python is a classic example. Smaller projects are probably BDFL by default, because there are only one or two maintainers. A project that originated at a company might also fall into the BDFL category. LINUX TORVALDS
    • Meritocracy: (Note: the term “meritocracy” carries negative connotations for some communities and has a complex social and political history.) Under a meritocracy, active project contributors (those who demonstrate “merit”) are given a formal decision making role. Decisions are usually made based on pure voting consensus. The meritocracy concept was pioneered by the Apache Foundation; all Apache projects are meritocracies. Contributions can only be made by individuals representing themselves, not by a company.
    • Liberal contribution: Under a liberal contribution model, the people who do the most work are recognized as most influential, but this is based on current work and not historic contributions. Major project decisions are made based on a consensus seeking process (discuss major grievances) rather than pure vote, and strive to include as many community perspectives as possible. Popular examples of projects that use a liberal contribution model include Node.js and Rust.

ANATOMY OF AN OSS PROJECT

LICENSE: By definition, every open source project must have an open source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source. 
    • README: The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started. 
    • CONTRIBUTING: Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to. 
    • CODE_OF_CONDUCT: The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants’ behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to. 
    • Other documentation: There might be additional documentation, such as tutorials, walkthroughs, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects.

Business Models

Open Core (Platform) or commercial extensions or versus Hybrid OSS
Open core is a business model in which the core of a program is open source, with additional closed source features provided for a fee.
- segment | analytics.js MongoDB 

Business source
Business source is a business model that employs two different licenses with a time delay. In this business model, the source code is openly distributed and freely editable. However, for a set amount of time, a pre-defined segment of users (0.1–1% is suggested) have to pay to be allowed to use it. After this initial time period (3 years is suggested), the license automatically changes to an open source license.

Software as a service
Software as a service (SaaS) is a fairly new business model in which connectors and application programming interfaces are open source but the server code they connect to is not accessible to the end user. For instance, one may use an application that can access certain data on a server, but not be able to access the actual source code
MongoDB ---- Wordpress

Dual licensing 
Dual licensing emerged as an early approach to the open source business model. Under this model, a company offers the same software under two different licenses, one that is open source, and the other proprietary. They can control the software, and contributors sign over their copyright.

BUSINESS CHALLENGES
- Competition is Healthy

- Sqlite, Mysql, MongoDB, couchbase, Postgres
- Angular, React, Vue
- Gitlab | Github | BitBucket | JIRA Atlassian

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
- Adoption and growing it .. USERBASE
Google increased it user base with android, by using one you were tied to a google account where all your data was mined.
When Google came out with Android they were not planning to make money on Android. They were planning to make money on those who make money on Android. Meaning when you sign the Open Handset Alliance and you start using Android in your phones, you bind yourself to using Google services, Search and so on, and that's business for Google

That's why Amazon took the Android code used it in their Kindle Fire, I think, but they can't call it Android because they didn't sign the Alliance that would have forced them to use Google Services. 



- Fragmentation | Forks, (Are they opportunities of problems)
Take Facebook, they needed a simple, scalable, powerful, reliable storage so they developed Cassandra. What happened to Cassandra? Facebook didn't need it anymore. Already from the beginning they open sourced it, gave it to everybody. Now we have a company called DataStax that commercializes Cassandra and further develops it. For DataStax that was a fantastic starting point for a business â€” to take an existing product that had been developed by somebody who really needed it. They knew it was a useful product. For them it was an opportunity, but for others it can be a threat.

Git > Github > Gitlab

- Community, users, contributors


- Branding and Identity
If you take Red Hat's code and distribute it, you can do that, but you're not allowed to distribute anything that shows the brand or the logo. The name Red Hat Enterprise, Linux and all the marks that go with it, the visual, the JPEGs and PNGs, and the pictures, they are all proprietary. 
So you have Debian | Fedora | Mint | ETC.

Legality NGOS and Accepting Donations

If you want to accept donations for your open source project, you can set up a donation button (using PayPal or Stripe, for example), but the money won’t be tax-deductible unless you are a qualifying nonprofit (a 501c3, if you’re in the US).
Many projects don’t wish to go through the trouble of setting up a nonprofit, so they find a nonprofit fiscal sponsor instead. A fiscal sponsor accepts donations on your behalf, usually in exchange for a percentage of the donation. Software Freedom Conservancy, Apache Foundation, Eclipse Foundation, Linux Foundation and Open Collective are examples of organizations that serve as fiscal sponsors for open source projects.



HOW TO GET STARTED WITH OSS

Do you like planning events?
    • Organize workshops or meetups about the project, like @fzamperin did for NodeSchool 
    • Organize the project’s conference (if they have one) 
    • Help community members find the right conferences and submit proposals for speaking 
Do you like to design?
    • Restructure layouts to improve the project’s usability 
    • Conduct user research to reorganize and refine the project’s navigation or menus, like Drupal suggests 
    • Put together a style guide to help the project have a consistent visual design 
    • Create art for t-shirts or a new logo, like hapi.js’s contributors did 
Do you like to write?
    • Write and improve the project’s documentation 
    • Curate a folder of examples showing how the project is used 
    • Start a newsletter for the project, or curate highlights from the mailing list 
    • Write tutorials for the project, like PyPA’s contributors did 
    • Write a translation for the project’s documentation 
 Seriously, [documentation] is mega-important. The documentation so far has been great and has been a killer feature of Babel. There are sections that could certainly use some work and even the addition of a paragraph here or there is extremely appreciated.
— @kittens, “Call for contributors” 
Do you like organizing?
    • Link to duplicate issues, and suggest new issue labels, to keep things organized 
    • Go through open issues and suggest closing old ones, like @nzakas did for ESLint 
    • Ask clarifying questions on recently opened issues to move the discussion forward 
Do you like to code?
    • Find an open issue to tackle, like @dianjin did for Leaflet 
    • Ask if you can help write a new feature 
    • Automate project setup 
    • Improve tooling and testing 
Do you like helping people?
    • Answer questions about the project on e.g., Stack Overflow (like this Postgres example) or Reddit 
    • Answer questions for people on open issues 
    • Help moderate the discussion boards or conversation channels 
Do you like helping others code?
    • Review code on other people’s submissions 
    • Write tutorials for how a project can be used 
    • Offer to mentor another contributor, like @ereichert did for @bronzdoc on Rust

## CONCLUSION
In the end some might say, there is no open source business model, only people using open-source as a development and/or distribution model in order to sell complementary services and products
